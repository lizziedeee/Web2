It was all a dream.
I used to read Word Up magazine.
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine.
Hangin' pictures on my wall.
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl.
I let my tape rock 'til my tape pop.
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock.
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack..
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha.
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far.
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight.
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade.
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner.
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner.
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky.
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would.
Call the crib, same number same hood.
It's all good...</p>

    <p>I made the change from a common thief.
To up close and personal with Robin Leach.
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day.
Spread love, it's the B R O O K L Y N way.
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy.
Girls used to diss me.
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me.
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff.
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff.
Now honies play me close like butter played toast.
From the Mississippi down to the east coast.
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks.
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak.
Livin' life without fear.
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ear.
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool.
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school.
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood.
And it's still all good...</p>

    

    <p>Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis.
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this.
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa.
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur.
Phone bill about two G's flat.
No need to worry, my accountant handles that.
And my whole crew is loungin'.
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin'.
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack.
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back.
And she loves to show me off, of course.
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source.
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us.
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us.
Birthdays was the worst days.
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay.
Uh, damn right I like the life I live.
'Cause I went from negative to positive.
And it's all G O O D...</p>
