<h2>I USED TO LOVE H.E.R. <br><small>COMMON SENSE</small></br></h2>


<p class="left">I met this girl, when I was ten years old.
And what I loved most she had so much soul.
She was old school, when I was just a shorty.
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checkin' her.
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart.
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park.
But she was there for me, and I was there for her.
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her.
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her.
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her.
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be.
Cause we related, physically and mentally.
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around.
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground.
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister.
Boy I tell ya, I miss her...Now periodically I would see,
</p>

<p class="right"> 
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties.
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick.
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric.
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions.
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence.
About my people she was teachin' me, by not preaching to me.
But speaking to me in a method that was leisurely.
So easily I approach.
She dug my rap, that's how we got close.
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool.
Cause around the same time, I went away to school.
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way.
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul.
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style.
She said, Afrocentricity...
